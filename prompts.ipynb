They exhibit irritability, fatigue, and difficulty sleeping. There's a noticeable difficulty recalling positive experiences (\"can't remember when I last felt happy\") and a tendency to dwell on negative experiences and people. While they articulate some positive qualities and coping mechanisms, there's an underlying sense of resignation and difficulty fully engaging with positive emotions. Their speech is somewhat rambling and fragmented at times, and they display moments of prolonged pauses.\n",

Positive relationships seem to be primarily with sisters.\n",

      "* **Sleep Disturbances:** Ongoing sleep issues can significantly impact mood, energy levels, and overall well-being.\n",
      "* **Potential Undiagnosed PTSD:** If symptoms align with PTSD, this could indicate unresolved trauma contributing to current symptoms and requiring targeted intervention.\n",
