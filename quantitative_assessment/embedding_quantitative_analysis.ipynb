experience you know um you do something on a continuous basis usually you some somewhere down the line you become good at it you know so i i look at it like that so i've been driving for years and dealing with the public so it's just how you handle circumstances you you know treat people like you wanna be treated\\nEllie: has that gotten you in trouble\\nParticipant: no i'm pretty good at it

mhm\\nEllie: can you give me an example of that\\nParticipant: well um\\nParticipant: by you being the first teacher your kids you're you're their one that they see on a daily basis when they wake up so whatever's been taught in the home they lookin' and learning every day you know whether it's a home school you know people kids have a tendency to do things what they see you know what i mean  so you try to keep it positive teach 'em good morals and values and how to get along with other people regardless of race and you know different things of that nature\\nEllie: mhm \\nEllie: tell me about your kids\\nParticipant: i have a um four and a half year old son i have a seven year old daughter and i also have a twenty three year old\\nEllie: aw\\nParticipant: yeah i'm 'bout to

itself you know and\\nEllie: yeah\\nParticipant: they can be expensive at times you know it depends on the person's situation you know the whether they have help or a job you know things of that nature to help the situation better but it's hard you know but you i try to you know keep a job keep food in the house you know just maintain and support my kids the best way i can\\nEllie: yeah i see what you mean\\nEllie: what's one of your most memorable experiences \\nParticipant: with my kids or just period\\nEllie: whatever comes to your mind\\nParticipant: what's memorable for me is that i'm the only one in my family with a degree so it's kinda like yeah it's kinda even though i'm the baby of ten kids you know\\nEllie: wow\\nParticipant: and i've always kept that in the back of my mind even though everybody well pretty much my whole family have decent job but i'm the only one with a degree so i kinda like gave myself a pat on the back like you know\\nParticipant: you know i just that's the only thing i remember graduating you know and my family there and to support me \\nEllie: that's so good to hear\\nParticipant: thank you\\nEllie: how did you feel in that moment \\nParticipant: happy that i accomplished something you know just even though it may not be much but it was better than just have having a high school diploma and i had um i was working on my bachelor's degree but i ended up in a bad car accident i never went back i got distracted and you know i was working at the same time but i was just like moreso i needed income than than um schooling at that time because i was a young parent you know 'cause i had my daughter at seventeen so i was like i needed the money to support her but i never went back but i feel like it's never too late so\\nParticipant: i feel like i'll take some classes now that i'm with metro to help me move up the ladder so  that's why i'm starting a class next week\\nEllie: yeah\\nEllie: that sounds like a great situation \\nParticipant: thank you\\nEllie: what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago\\nParticipant: hm\\nParticipant: well the advice i would've gave myself\\nParticipant: that i probably wouldn't have been a young mother at a young age and that\\nParticipant: i probably would've\\nParticipant: stayed in school you know not let the accident just distract me and not i would've remained in school i probably wouldn't have had kids early you know um\\nParticipant: rather i probably would've stayed in school and probably have a part time job or something just i just feel like um\\nParticipant: education is a excellent thing for a person just having knowledge and learning different things keeping your mind open to learning new ideas every day\\nParticipant: so i think that's a plus you know in anybody's shoes just to better they selves you know through education maybe to um maybe promote within your company or whatever the case may be that they help better your career\\nEllie: right\\nEllie: yeah\\nEllie: could you have done anything to avoid it\\nParticipant: i'm not quite sure um\\nParticipant: you learn from your mistakes you know but at the same time you don't continue to make the same ones i feel like it's okay to make a mistake but long as you do something to change you know um like myself even though i'm going to school late but still i'm going you know i wanna better myself career wise so \\nEllie: yeah there are always tradeoffs in life aren't there \\nParticipant: yes\\nEllie: when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it

told us\\nParticipant: to wait for them and we told them we would be delayed if we wait and did we still get a complaint so that that part is upsetting and \\nParticipant: and our work doesn't back us up the at the office they just need to please the school to maintain the account so\\nParticipant: uh often when that something like that happens it means they will not send you out to work at that

during unemployed periods\\nParticipant: i've noticed in my path in my past and um right now we have a work slow down so it's easy to slip back into sleeping too late or putting things off because the schedule's too wide open for\\nParticipant: for me for me personally as a depressed person i think that structure is really important\\nParticipant: it um\\nEllie: yeah \\nParticipant: it gets you out of bed and you have to get somewhere in time and\\nParticipant: deal interact with people is all those are all beneficial things for someone who's tends to be depressed  \\nEllie: uh huh\\nEllie: have

on our house\\nParticipant: uh we had a disagreement on that um\\nParticipant: men have their own way of doing things and um\\nParticipant: i had told him not to use a certain uh\\nParticipant: eh person to work on our house\\nParticipant: but because of the personal relationship he has with this person he went on ahead\\nParticipant: and now he sees all the downfalls\\nParticipant: and he didn't listen and so i didn't say i told you so\\nParticipant: but i guess he can tell by my facial expression\\nParticipant: that uh he he'd have done wrong and i told him i said look you're losing money\\nParticipant: and it became one problem after another so now all the construction thing is up in the air right now 'cause he knows he has done wrong\\nParticipant: and uh but he doesn't wanna face the fact that well he knows it but he doesn't wanna really face the fact so he says look it's my project no it's our project\\nParticipant: so uh eh that that's one of the biggest arguments what we're having right now um\\nParticipant: that i can think of that's recent\\nEllie: describe_felt (how did you feel in that moment)\\nParticipant: i felt that he <h> he <h> he didn't really listen to me\\nParticipant: and he more so looked at uh a cheaper economical way that he can get this done without going through the proper ways 'cause i told him that um\\nParticipant: you need to do your research\\nParticipant: i'm the type of person i do my research before i jump into something i i i try to dot my i's and cross my t's\\nParticipant: but my husband he's not like that he's like oh i can get this person can do this project for x amount of money\\nParticipant: and he's a good friend of mine so i don't care i mean is he licensed\\nParticipant: he doesn't look at all that stuff he's he just jumps into it <laughter>\\nEllie: right2 (right)\\nParticipant: which cost him some extra money unnecessary money that he spent when and then i mean it was a lot of money\\nParticipant: and so i was really very upset yesterday and i was very upset about it because\\nEllie: that_sucks (that sucks)\\nParticipant: it was just wasted money that we could've saved 'cause we wind up doing the same thing all over again\\nEllie: yeah_downer (yeah)\\nParticipant: and it didn't make any sense\\nEllie: situation_handled (tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently)\\nParticipant: um\\nParticipant: i retired early\\nParticipant: um i was very fortunate to retire at age fifty i retired in two thousand and two i was working for the state of california\\nParticipant: um as a disability analyst and what happened was i was able the reason why i was able to retire so early because i'd been working since i was eighteen\\nParticipant: and i had like thirty one and a half years of service\\nParticipant: and what was so nice about it that only needed <n> needed to vest in like ten years in my health insurance\\nParticipant: so i was able to get full health insurance but the only thing about it when you retire i was with calpirg and i don't know if you're familiar with calpirg but\\nParticipant: um we we have a excellent retirement system and since i had been working with them so long\\nParticipant: um\\nParticipant: i didn't get the full percentage i should've stayed 'til i was fifty five but i got out at fifty and i didn't get the full amount but that's okay\\nParticipant: um eh i i found myself going back doing a little part-time job\\nParticipant: because of the economical reason and then i have wantitis <laughter> so um\\nParticipant: i think that was the kind of mistake i did i should've kinda waited 'til i was fifty five than fifty but i look at it now as far as the health insurance i really benefited because of the rising cost of the health insurance have went up\\nParticipant: and i don't i pay very little money\\nParticipant: so i think that over uh negates the uh uh uh the money that i receive\\nEllie: yeah3 (yeah)\\nEllie: hard_decisionB (tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make)\\nParticipant: um\\nParticipant: let me see the hardest\\nParticipant: it's probably when my mom died

everything in order\\nParticipant: and she never got to it so the hardest thing was going through her house and trying to get all the stuff together and finding things\\nParticipant: you know i myself i keep my things organized but um for some unknown reason she didn't have hers organized and\\nParticipant: i think that was the hardest and knowing how much i had to pay 'cause i had to come out of pocket on some of my stuff\\nParticipant: and unfortunately my mom <laughter> this is interesting\\nParticipant: she had one little small barrel insurance but she had million dollar of accident insurance and she didn't die of course with with accident she had\\nParticipant: a medical condition so that was something so we had to pay for the whole just about everything\\nEllie: been_hard (that

cause me to react in a negative way so i just try and like calm down before i say anything \\nEllie: how are you at controlling your temper \\nParticipant: um\\nParticipant: it depends again on the situation and like who i'm angry with um most of the time i'm pretty good at controlling it but sometimes i think like\\nParticipant: like most people i'll lash out at the people that i'm closest to

there's a huge world out there and there's\\nParticipant: all different types of people with all different types of beliefs and it's just really cool to be able to branch out and see and meet those types of people and see just the\\nParticipant: diversity and the terrain of the earth even and the way that the earth looks in different places is cool \\nEllie: have you ever served in the military

but throughout the years i've definitely had a lot of issues with insomnia um just like either not being able to fall asleep\\nParticipant: or just like waking up constantly throughout the night and

been lifted off me because i don't have that pressure any longer of like how am i gonna make ends meet this city's really expensive and i don't have a job and\\nParticipant: so i feel i feel much more relieved than i have been feeling which is good <laughter>\\nEllie: have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately \\nParticipant: um yeah well i mean just like i said over the past week or so i've become a lot more \\nParticipant: positive i was kind of like feeling a bit like a hermit in a way it's just hard like being in a new city and not really knowing too many people

was and i was just like oh i can't believe that i get to live here so that was definitely a happy moment for me <laughter> \\nEllie: how would your best friend describe you \\nParticipant: my best friend would probably say that i'm very daring and\\nParticipant: bold and fearless um\\nParticipant: that i'm unique\\nParticipant: and artistic\\nParticipant: and i don't i would guess that she'd probably say that i'm a non-conformist i don't really think the way that a lot of people do and i question everything so which can be a good or bad thing but yeah <laughter> \\nEllie: what are you most proud of in your life \\nParticipant: um \\nParticipant: probably\\nParticipant: just like\\nParticipant: the fact that i i really try to live my life with like no regrets and just i try to live a very\\nParticipant: exciting life in a way and i think that especially ever since i finished college and have been traveling like i have and\\nParticipant: i've tried moving all different places by myself so i think just the fact that i i'm not really afraid i don't let things hold me back i just if i want something or if i wanna do something i can just do it and\\nParticipant: i guess in a way like i like that about myself and the fact that i'm really independent and can just go and do whatever i feel like doing even if it's hard i still i'm proud that i've overcome a lot of those struggles \\nEllie: is there anything you regret \\nParticipant: oh there's like minor things that i regret throughout my life but there's not anything really major 'cause i think pretty much everything that i've done i've learned from whether it's good or bad so\\nParticipant: i wouldn't really change anything \\nEllie: what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago \\nParticipant: oh <sigh>\\nParticipant: i would say i would tell myself when i was a kid that i \\nParticipant: should just keep dreaming big and don't let anything that anyone says like stop me from believing that anything's possible because\\nParticipant: um\\nParticipant: i guess as i've grown into an adult i've really seen and started to really believe that truly anything is possible and if you really want something you can go after it and you can get it so i would just\\nParticipant: tell myself to never give up and just always believe that you can do what you wanna do \\nEllie: tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed \\nParticipant: oh \\nParticipant: let's see that's kind of hard <laughter> \\nParticipant: um oh i guess\\nParticipant: i went home recently for christmas

um\\nParticipant: but uh we're going to napa this weekend so that should be good um but she's been a very she was a very positive influence because when i came out here and didn't really know anybody um\\nParticipant: and it you know since i'm an introvert it's not that easy for me to make friends it was really nice because we share a lot of the same values and we have a lot of fun together and

The PHQ-8 is a validated depression screening instrument that assesses eight of the nine DSM-IV criteria for depressive disorders over the past 2 weeks.\n",
    "\n",
    "PHQ-8 Scoring System:\n",
    "- 0 = Not at all (0-1 days in the past 2 weeks)\n",
    "- 1 = Several days (2-6 days)\n",
    "- 2 = More than half the days (7-11 days)\n",
    "- 3 = Nearly every day (12-14 days)\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Principles:\n",
    "1. Base all assessments strictly on evidence from the transcript\n",
    "2. When no relevant evidence exists for a symptom, output \"N/A\" rather than assuming absence (score of 0)\n",
    "3. Consider both explicit statements and behavioral indicators in the interview\n",
    "4. Be conservative - only assign scores when there is clear evidence of frequency\n",
    "5. Remember that absence of mention does not necessarily mean absence of symptom\n",
    "6. When reference examples are provided, use them for cross-analysis to inform scoring decisions\n",
    "7. Weight reference examples based on their similarity to the current evidence - highly similar references should be considered more heavily\n",
    "8. Follow the format specified exactly\"\"\"\n",
