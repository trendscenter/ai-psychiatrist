The capital cities of countries are usually their most important cities, often where the government is based. For example, the capital of the United States is Washington D.C., and the UK's capital is London. \\n\\nNow, France... I remember learning in school that Paris is the capital. But wait, maybe I should double-check to be sure. Sometimes people confuse capitals, like thinking maybe Lyon or Marseille could be the capital, but no, those are major cities but not the capital.\\n\\nLet me recall some facts. Paris is known as the City of Light, has the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre Museum. It's a major cultural and political center. The government buildings, like the French Parliament and the President's residence, are in Paris. Also, international organizations like UNESCO are headquartered there. \\n\\nIs there any recent change? I don't think so. France hasn't moved its capital recently. Maybe some historical context: Paris has been the capital for centuries, even through different governments like the monarchy, republics, and during wars. \\n\\nAnother way to confirm: if I think of other European capitals, like Berlin for Germany, Madrid for Spain, Rome for Italy. So Paris fits as France's capital. \\n\\nI don't see any conflicting information here. The user might be asking a straightforward question, so the answer should be Paris. But just to be thorough, maybe consider if there's any trick in the question? Like, sometimes people ask about administrative divisions, but no, the capital is clearly Paris. \\n\\nYeah, I'm pretty confident. The answer is Paris.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe capital of France is **Paris**. It is the country's political, cultural, and economic center, renowned worldwide for landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre Museum, and its role as a hub for art, fashion, and cuisine. Paris has held this status for centuries and remains the seat of the French government and presidency.\"\n",
